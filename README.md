# GreenTemp
Temporal and spatial temperature measurement in a greenhouse - Agrotech course final project.<br>
Our main goals:
1. Having fun ðŸ¥³
2. Examining the change of temperatures inside the greenhouse as a function of:
    - The height of the sample point.
    - The distance of the sample point from the greenhouse's cooling pad system.

# Code & Thingspeak
### Preperation ###
All of the code used in this project is found in the 'Code' folder.

In order to proceed with the code make sure the following libraries are installed:
- OneWire
- Adafruit_Unified_Sensor
- Adafruit_SHT31_Library
- DallasTemperature
- ThingSpeak

after installing all the relevant libraries we shall proceed.
first of all is finding the DS18B20 addresses. in order to read this component the address is needed, each one has a unique address so it lets us read pretty much as many as we want as long as we have its address.
In order to find the address we first need to assemble the next circuit:

</p>

Now we are going to find the address of each one of the DS18B20 sensors. 
In order to do that, flash the code inside of 'find_DS18B20.ino' to your ESP32.

After getting the addresses we proceeded and built the circuit mentioned above. We used the code found in 'symphonyOfSensors.ino' to integrate all of our components.
Go ahead and boot it to your ESP32.




# Data Analysis
In order to get a 3d plot containing the current temperatures from all the sensor, run the code from the attached file: 'Agtech_final_project_3D_Temp_plotting'.

Example for a 3d plot generated by the code:
