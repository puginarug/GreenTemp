# GreenTemp
Temporal and spatial temperature measurement in a greenhouse - Agrotech course final project.<br>

Our main goals:
1. Having fun ðŸ¥³
2. Answering the following questions:
    - What is the temperture gradiant across the greenhouse?
    - Does the cooling system cool the whole space equally?
    
In order to answer these questions, we built a system that lets us examin the change of temperatures inside the greenhouse as a function of:
- The height of the sample point.
- The distance of the sample point from the greenhouse's cooling pad system.
