# GreenTemp
Temporal and spatial temperature measurement in a greenhouse - Agrotech course final project.<br>
Our main goals:
1. Having fun ðŸ¥³
2. Examining the change of temperatures inside the greenhouse as a function of:
    - The height of the sample point.
    - The distance of the sample point from the greenhouse's cooling pad system.

# Data Analysis
In order to get a 3d plot containing the current temperatures from all the sensor, run the code from the attached file: 'Agtech_final_project_3D_Temp_plotting'.

Example for a 3d plot generated by the code:
