# Components
In order to build one measuring station we used the following parts:
1. 1x <a href=http://esp32.net/>ESP32.</a><br>
    
2. 2x <a href=https://www.adafruit.com/product/2857>SHT31</a> I2C temprature and humidity sensors.<br>
    
3. 1x <a href=https://www.adafruit.com/product/2717>TCA9548A</a> I2C Multiplexer.<br>
    
4. 4x <a href=https://components101.com/sensors/ds18b20-temperature-sensor>DS18B20</a> Thermometers (more can be connected)<br>
    
5. 1x 4.7kÎ© Resistor
6. 1x <a href=https://www.electricaltechnology.org/2019/11/12v-to-5v-converter-circuit.html>buck converter</a> 12V to 5V (didactable if chosen to connect via USB)<br>
    

in order to assmble it on top of the prototype board we had to use some Male to Female mounts that were souldred to the board itself. a 3-wire connector and two 4 wire connectors. The circuit itself was assembled with thin coated wires that were wire turned on top of the souldered pins. the SHT-31 sensors were all connected via 4 core wire and mounts that we crimped on to the wires. Similarly done we took four 4 core wires that were crimped in one side and braided them in order to connect the DS18B20

# Instructions
We made 3 copies of the circuit that is shown below, in order to take temperature samples from all over the greenhouse.
For each circuit:
- We've soldered the required components to a stripboard, whereas components that are more expensive or reusable (ESP32, multiplexers, etc.) were not soldered directly, but had attachments that were soldered to the stripboard.

</p>

- The cables of the circuit it self were wire turned on top of the pins sticking from the bottom of the board.
The end product eventually looked like this:

</p>

- We connected each sensor to a cable, in order to give us more flexibility with the project placement and for exceeding the measuring range of the project. the cables were made as mensioned above with a crimper.
- Each board was encapsulated in a humidity-proof plastic box in order to keep the electric components dry and safe.
- The project is powered by a 12V power source, which is converted to a 5V with the help of a buck-converter.
- Each box is placed in the desired locations, according to the researcher's interest.

# Our Circuit Diagram
the connections were made on the back of the board according to the schematics down below:

- Red wire: power (3.3V)
- Black wire: Ground
- Blue wire: SCA and data
- Purple wire: SDA
